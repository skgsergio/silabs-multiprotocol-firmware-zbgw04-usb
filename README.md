**ℹ️  IMPORTANT:** Firmware in this repo is manually built, this is unreliable in
terms of build reproducibility and will cause slower releases when a new version
is required. I highly encourage you to use the following repos to get
your firmware as they use the automated build system by Nabu Casa for several
devices:

- https://github.com/darkxst/silabs-firmware-builder

The latest firmware builds from `darkxst` can also be installed using this web flasher (chrome/edge only):

# Multiprotocol/MultiPAN RCP Firmware for USB Dongles ZB-GW04 based on ZYZBP008 SM-011

This repository aims to provide firmware files for ZB-GW04 dongles that are
compatible with Home Assistant's [Silicon Labs Multiprotocol Addon][silabs-multiprotocol].

Original firmware source: [SiliconLabs Multiprotocol (OpenThread+Zigbee) RCP
(rcp-uart-802154)][silabs-gecko].

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER:** Use these firmware files at your own risk. I will upload them
after testing them myself, however, I am not an expert on these devices.

I bought both my v1.1 and v1.2 at [EasyIoT / eWeSmart Store][aliexpress-easyiot]
Aliexpress store, but many other stores sell it, although the images in the
[ZB-GW04 listing][aliexpress-easyiot-zbgw04] shows hardware version v1.1 at the
time of this writting (February 2023) they are selling hardware version v1.2
which is better as it supports hardware flow control.

## Flashing instructions

Use [universal-silabs-flasher][universal-silabs-flasher] as follows:

```sh
universal-silabs-flasher \
    --device /dev/ttyUSB0 \
    --baudrate XXXXXX \
    flash \
    --firmware FIRMWARE_FILE.gbl \
    --allow-cross-flashing
```

Set the baudrate parameter to the baudrate of the current firmware in the USB
Dongle, from factory it comes with a `115200` baudrate firmware and here I build
firmwares with `115200` or `230400`, it is specified in the firmware file
name.

If the wrong baudrate is used the flasher will fail with the message: `Error:
Failed to probe running application type`.

## Versions

The following table lists which firmware you should use based on Home
Assistant's Silicon Labs Multiprotocol Addon version.

This table only lists versions that have introduced a required firmware change,
this means that if you are using an intermediate version between two listed
versions then you must use the firmware of the next lower version listed.

My recommendation is to always use the latest available version of the addon.

As I myself am the main user of these firmwares, I will try to have the firmware
versions ready before the addon is updated. When an addon update is available
check in the changelog if it mentions "Gecko SDK" updates, if so check this
repository for the required firmware version.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Pick the correct firmware version for your dongle
revision. Firmware with hardware flow control WON'T work in dongles that doesn't
support it. So please check carefully which dongle revision you own.

**ℹ️ NOTE:** NCP firmwares in this repo are not tested in depth, I only build
them for ZigBee sniffing purposes using [`bellows dump`][bellows]. They are
built with the default firmware source parameters (configuring the CTUNE and
UART) and adding the Manufacturing Library (mfglib) for the sniffing
capability.
